## JMeter Downloads and Dependencioes

This is what you need to participate in this part of the workshop.

### Java 8

You will need Java 8. Java.com link: https://www.java.com/en/download/

If you object to Oracle's licenese, OpenJDK is your best option: https://openjdk.java.net/. 

If you already have Oracle Java, you can check your current Java version in the Java control panel for: 
Windows: https://www.java.com/en/download/help/win_controlpanel.html

### JMeter 5.4.3

Download the JMeter Binary here: https://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi. 5.4.3 is the version tested for the workshop

## The JMeter Script

For the workshop, we are using a script from the tutorial BlazeMeter provides here: https://www.blazemeter.com/blog/getting-started-jmeter-basic-tutorial

BlazeMeter is a public test cloud for running JMeter scripts at scale, across geographies. I have used it to successfully load test with hundreds of thousands of concurrent users. Learn more at https://www.blazemeter.com/. 

There are other load tools and test cloud providers, and many of them are excellent.
